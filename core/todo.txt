TileMap to GameWorld Rules
----------------------------------
- Non-objects will stay in the TileMap and be rendered independently from entities
	- However, [Shape]MapObjects with the type "body" will be added to the physics world, 
	  detached from everything.
- All entities SHOULD be derived from TextureMapObjects (until further notice)
	- These will be EXTRACTED from the TileMap, processed, and inserted into the GameWorld
	- The physics body size will be determined from the object size UNLESS:
		- The object has a property "body_skeleton_ref", whose value is the name of shape MapObject with type "body_skeleton"
	- Animated entities will just override get_sprite
		- The texture region from the TileMap is just used for visualization in Tiled
		- It will be ignored when the entity is created 
	- Each entity will have a static function: buildFromMapObject(TextureMapObject mapObject)
		- From this, we can get the id, position, texture region, and custom properties
		- The custom properties will be validated against EntityPropertyValidator
	- An entity's id will be derived from a MapObject's name (not id)
		- The name is not part of the MapObject's properties
	- An entity's type will be derived from a MapObject's type property

- How to assign ordering to drawing layers?
	- Foreground (e.g. grass)
	- Solid Bodies (e.g. entities, ground)
	- Particle Effects (e.g. dying effect)
	- Animations (e.g. waterfall)
	- Enclosing Walls (e.g. dirt wall)
	- Clouds (e.g. clouds)
	- Background (e.g. mountains)


- WeatherSystem
	- Clouds, rain, and night/day???
- GameWorldLoader support for sensor locations
- Keep track of last touched body for player respawn, instead of position
	- Then just center the player on that body when respawned.
